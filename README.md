# Strict encoding

#### Protobufs for functional programming

This is a set of libraries for deterministic binary serialization using
[strict types] &ndash; type system made with category theory which ensures
provable properties and bounds for the in-memory and serialized type 
representation.

The development of the libraries is performed by 
[UBIDECO Institute](https://ubideco.org).

## Overview

Strict types is a formal notation for defining and serializing
[generalized algebraic data types (GADT)][gadt] in a deterministic
and confined way. It is developed with [type theory] in mind.

Strict Types are:
* __schema-based__ (with the schema being strict encoding notation),
* __semantic__, i.e. defines types not just as they are layed out in memory,
  but also depending on their meaning,
* __deterministic__, i.e. produces the same result for a given type,
* __portabile__, i.e. can run on ahy hardware architecture and OS, including
  low-performant embedded systems,
* __confined__, i.e. provides guarantees and static analysis on a maximum size
  of the typed data,
* __formally verifiable__.

**Strict Encoding** is set of libraries for serializing / deserializing data
types in binary formats.
